NAME
    pkg-catalog.lib.sh - package catalog snapshot and lookup operations

DESCRIPTION
    pkg-catalog.lib.sh owns acquisition and lookup of the package catalog used by
    package operations. It keeps catalog mechanics out of package request grammar
    and installation orchestration.

FUNCTIONS
    pkg_catalog_init <catalog-variable> <head-variable> <work-root> <cache-root>
        Read the configured catalog repository, update or create the cached Git
        checkout, resolve one exact HEAD and export that revision into
        <work-root>/catalog.

        On success <catalog-variable> receives the exported snapshot directory and
        <head-variable> receives the exact Git revision. The destination variable
        names must be distinct valid shell identifiers. <work-root> and
        <cache-root> must be existing real directories and <work-root>/catalog
        must not already exist. Catalog refresh command output is kept off standard
        output; results are returned through the assigned variables.

    pkg_catalog_stream_resolve <stream-variable> <identity-osarch-variable> <catalog> <package> <target-osarch>
        Resolve one package stream from an already materialized catalog snapshot.
        The target-osarch stream is preferred when present; otherwise the all
        stream is used.

        On success <stream-variable> receives the selected stream path.
        <identity-osarch-variable> receives <target-osarch> for a platform
        specific stream or the empty string for an all stream.

    pkg_catalog_version_resolve <version-variable> <stream> [<requested-version>]
        Resolve a repository version through the adapter owned by one catalog
        stream. With <requested-version>, resolution must return that exact version;
        without it, the repository adapter selects its normal current/latest
        version. On success <version-variable> receives the validated version.

    pkg_catalog_range_resolve <range-variable> <catalog> <concrete>
        Resolve an already concrete package identity to its applicable catalog
        range directory in the supplied snapshot.

        The concrete identity determines the exact stream: identities carrying
        !<osarch> use that stream, while platform-independent identities use all.
        Range numbering must be contiguous from n0001 and anchors must be strictly
        increasing according to the stream repository adapter.

        On success <range-variable> receives the selected range path.

RETURN STATUS
    0   Success.
    1   Catalog state, lookup, repository metadata or requested value is invalid
        or cannot be resolved.
    2   Invalid function invocation.
