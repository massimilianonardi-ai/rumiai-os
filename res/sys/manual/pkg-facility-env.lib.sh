NAME
    pkg-facility-env.lib.sh - internal env facility-part conformance handler

DESCRIPTION
    pkg-facility-env.lib.sh implements the trusted internal validation semantics for
    the env typed facility part. It validates realization structure and descriptors
    using the root, root-path and literal grammar, and composes that validation with
    exact contract membership for provider conformance. Package integration reuses
    the same internal realization validation without acquiring catalog context.

    PATH is a valid special env contract member. Provider realizations may contain
    multiple PATH records, but PATH accepts only root and root-path descriptors;
    literal PATH replacement is rejected. Ordinary environment variables remain
    single-record realization members.

    The library validates declarations only; it does not export variables, select a
    provider or modify bootstrap state.

FUNCTIONS
    This library exposes no public callable functions.
