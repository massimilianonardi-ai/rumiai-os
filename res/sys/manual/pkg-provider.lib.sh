NAME
    pkg-provider.lib.sh - manage package facility provider configuration

DESCRIPTION
    pkg-provider.lib.sh implements the provider-selection configuration surface used
    by the public pkg provider command.

    Facility defaults are system-scoped package-subsystem configuration. A facility
    default owns global command publication for that facility through bin/ext and
    bin/ext-<osarch> and contributes the selected provider's facility environment
    to each new m bootstrap. Facility-default selectors are non-secret runtime
    selection metadata: their storage is read-only/traversable for runtime accounts
    that must resolve global/system-host intent, while mutation remains protected by
    normal filesystem ownership. Consumer bindings are system-scoped package
    configuration stored as binding/<facility> beneath the consumer package conf
    area. A binding file contains exactly one provider selector followed by newline.
    Provider selectors are non-secret runtime-selection metadata; both defaults and
    bindings may be made read-only/traversable for a service account while their
    enclosing state remains non-writable to that account.

    Global environment is materialized as derived system environment cache when
    facility-default or provider-package-default state changes. The materializer
    resolves every supported osarch, extracts assignments common to all platform
    contexts into the generic env snapshot and writes remaining assignments into
    env-<osarch> snapshots. Facility defaults are processed in LC_ALL=C facility
    order and later assignments win duplicate ordinary variables.

    PATH is a special facility-env projection. It accepts root/root-path descriptors
    only, may repeat, and contributes managed provider directories rather than
    replacing the whole PATH. A PATH root-path descriptor must resolve to a directory
    contained by the provider useful root. Later contributions have higher precedence.

FUNCTIONS
    pkg_provider_default_resolve <facility>
        Resolve the configured system facility default to one installed concrete
        provider using the same active global package-class semantics as global
        facility publication/environment. Consumer bindings are not consulted.

        Returns 0 and prints the concrete identity on success, 1 when no system
        facility default is configured, 2 for invalid invocation/facility syntax,
        and 3 when configured/default state exists but cannot be validated or
        resolved.

    pkg_provider_default_runtime_access_prepare <facility>
        Prepare the configured facility-default selector for read-only resolution
        by a non-owner runtime account. The function changes only traversal/read
        permissions on the facility-default configuration path; it does not change
        selector intent, provider installation or consumer bindings.

    pkg_provider_global_runtime_access_prepare
        Prepare every configured system facility-default selector for read-only
        enumeration/resolution by a non-owner runtime account that explicitly uses
        live provider-selection APIs. The m bootstrap does not require this access
        for global environment loading because it consumes materialized environment
        cache instead. Selector intent is not changed.

    pkg_provider_effective_selector_runtime_access_prepare <consumer> <facility>
        Prepare explicit selector metadata used by one consumer/facility pair for
        read-only resolution by a non-owner runtime account. An explicit binding is
        prepared when present; otherwise a configured system facility default is
        prepared. If neither exists, no selector-state preparation is required
        because package-consumer resolution may be implicit. Selector intent is not
        changed.

    pkg_provider_effective_selector <consumer> <facility>
        Print the effective explicitly configured selector for the consumer/facility
        pair: the explicit consumer binding when present, otherwise the configured
        system facility default. Returns 1 when neither selector is configured,
        2 for invalid invocation/syntax and 3 when selector configuration exists but
        is invalid. Installed-provider fallback belongs to pkg-dependency.lib.sh,
        not to this configuration API.

    pkg_provider_selector_resolve <provider-selector> [<consumer-osarch>]
        Resolve selector intent to one installed concrete package identity. A
        selector without version follows the provider package default. A selector
        with version is pinned. When consumer-osarch is supplied, a matching
        platform-specific provider is preferred and a generic provider may satisfy
        a selector that did not explicitly pin another osarch.

    pkg_provider_concrete_referenced <concrete-provider>
        Return 0 when the concrete provider is currently selected by a system
        facility default or a system consumer binding, 1 when it is not referenced,
        and 2 when the request or authoritative configuration cannot be validated.

    pkg_provider_environment_apply <facility> <concrete-provider>
        Validate and apply one installed concrete provider's facility-env projection
        to the current process. The projection is interpreted without shell
        evaluation and is validated as a whole before export.

    pkg_provider_global_environment_apply
        Recompute and apply the environment of all currently resolvable system
        facility defaults to the current process. This API remains available for
        direct runtime use; the m bootstrap does not call it.

    pkg_provider_global_environment_materialize
        Recompute all supported-osarch global facility environments and atomically
        publish the derived env and env-<osarch> snapshots under the system
        sys/environment cache. Ordinary assignments common to every platform are
        placed in env. PATH is common only when its complete resolved contribution
        sequence is identical for every platform.

    pkg_provider_package_default_reconcile <package> <osarch> <old-concrete> <new-concrete>
        Reconcile global commands affected by one package-default transition. For
        unversioned facility selectors this updates the selected command set while
        preserving selector-based targets. A pinned selector without osarch remains
        pinned but is published or removed as the corresponding package class
        appears or disappears. osarch is empty for the generic package class.
        Unrelated external-command collisions are rejected.

    pkg_provider default <facility>
        Print the configured system default provider selector for the facility.

    pkg_provider default <facility> <provider-selector>
        Set the configured system default provider selector and reconcile the
        facility's owned global command projection.

    pkg_provider default -u [--] <facility>
        Remove the configured system default provider selector and its owned global
        command projection.

    pkg_provider bind <consumer> <facility>
        Print the configured provider selector for that consumer/facility pair.

    pkg_provider bind <consumer> <facility> <provider-selector>
        Set the consumer/facility provider selector.

    pkg_provider bind -u [--] <consumer> <facility>
        Remove the consumer binding. Package-consumer dependency resolution then
        uses the facility default when configured and otherwise may use deterministic
        implicit installed-provider resolution.

PROVIDER SELECTORS
    Provider selectors use package-spec syntax:

        <package>
        <package>@<version>
        <package>!<osarch>
        <package>@<version>!<osarch>

    This library stores selector intent; it does not install providers or choose a
    missing provider automatically. Unversioned global command links target provider
    package-default selectors; pinned selectors target pinned provider concretes.
    Facility-default and provider-package-default mutations reconcile generated
    environment snapshots before returning. New m executions source those already
    resolved snapshots and perform no provider resolution.

RETURN STATUS
    Unless a function documents a more specific status contract:
    0   Requested query or mutation succeeded.
    1   Required configured state is absent or configuration storage could not be
        read or changed safely.
    2   Invocation, consumer/facility name or provider-selector syntax is invalid.

    pkg_provider_default_resolve additionally uses status 3 for an existing
    configured/default state that is invalid or cannot resolve to an installed
    concrete.

DEPENDENCIES
    The library runs inside the m bootstrap environment. Authoritative selector
    configuration remains under package subsystem state; generated global
    environment is written under the system sys/environment cache.
